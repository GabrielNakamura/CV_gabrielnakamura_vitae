	abstract = {Among the oldest winged insects, odonates are a monophyletic order that have become important models for ecological studies because of their highly diverse reproductive behaviors and their role as top predators and bioindicators. However, knowledge on evolutionary relationships within the order is still scarce compared to other taxa, and this situation is even more complicated in areas with high biodiversity, such as in the Amazon. Here, we sought to identify knowledge gaps on Amazonian Odonata regarding three main aspects: (i) how the inclusion of Amazonian taxa affects our interpretation of the evolutionary relationships of Zygoptera and Anisoptera; (ii) the position of Amazonian taxa in the existing supertree of the Odonata; (iii) dating evolutionary divergence between nodes using fossil records; (iv) assessing whether more species-rich basins (e.g., Amazon basin) have a larger phylogenetic gap when compared to basins with lower richness in South and Central America; and (v) in the light of our knowledge, we discuss diversification patterns found in the most predominant clades of Amazonian taxa. We built a supertree from currently available phylogenetic information of Odonata. The results show that there is no genetic information for 85\% (n: 503) of the Amazonian species and that family level relationships are unknown for 17 genera. After compiling the data, we observed that clades belonging to Neotropical lineages are the most poorly resolved, with large polytomies. This problem was identified in many Anisoptera genera, such as Macrothemis, Dasythemis, Elasmothemis, and Erythrodiplax. Our results also suggest that not always the richest basins have the greatest phylogenetic gaps. As expected, we found important gaps in the existing Odonata phylogenies, especially in clades that include Amazonian representatives, that are also those less known from ecological and conservation perspectives.},

Such assessment has been often performed based on the phylogenetic structure of local assemblages. We underline some issues with that approach, and show that more reliable evaluation of historical events influencing present-day diversity can be achieved by combining phylogenetic diversity to an estimate of species assemblage age based on ancestral range estimation. We apply the new approach to test two concurrent hypotheses-Tropical Niche Conservatism (TNC) and Out of The Tropics (OTT)-which provide alternative explanations to species richness gradients, as possible explanations to higher species richness in tropical assemblages of Tyrannidae birds in relation to temperate ones across the American continent. Tropical assemblages tended to be older and to show higher phylogenetic diversity than temperate ones, suggesting that recent events of historical dispersal carried out by few lineages likely drove species assembly in younger temperate assemblages. This finding provides support to TNC as the most probable explanation to species richness variation in tyrannid assemblages across the Americas. Combining phylogenetic structure measures with a flexible assemblage age metric calculated from ancestral range estimation allows deeper understanding of current diversity gradients.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Patterns of species replacement and richness differences along environmental gradients or ecoregions shed light on different ecological and evolutionary mechanisms acting on community structure. Communities of aquatic ecosystems of different watersheds are supposed to host distinct species and lineages. Quantifying and understanding the degree to which these differences are affected by environmental and biogeographical factors remains an open question for these environments, particularly in the Neotropical region. We investigated patterns of taxonomic and phylogenetic composition of headwater streams of the Paraná and Paraguai River basins to understand how local and biogeographical factors affect the assembly of fish communities. We also quantified taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity by decomposing them into nestedness and turnover components. We found that local environmental factors are the main factors influencing the composition of stream fish communities. Whereas pH affected both taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover, water velocity was responsible for phylogenetic turnover and pH was the main driver of phylogenetic nestedness. Our results indicate an effect of local environmental factors in determining the structure of headwater stream fish communities through a combination of a species sorting mechanism (water velocity and pH) and phylogenetic habitat filtering (pH).RESUMO Padrões de substituição de espécies ou diferenças de riqueza ao longo de gradientes ambientais ou ecoregiões lançam luz sobre diferentes processos e mecanismos ecológicos atuando na estruturação das comunidades. Supõe-se que comunidades aquáticas pertencentes a diferentes bacias pertençam a linhagens evolutivas distintas. Quantificar e entender o grau em que tais diferenças são resultado de fatores ambientais locais e/ou processos biogeográficos ainda é uma questão pouco explorada. Neste estudo nós investigamos os padrões de composição taxonômica e filogenética em riachos de cabeceira das bacias dos Rios Paraná e Paraguai, para entender como fatores locais e biogeográficos afetam a estruturação das comunidades de peixes. Nós quantificamos a diversidade beta taxonômica e filogenética decompondo estas em aninhamento e substituição. Encontramos que os fatores ambientais locais são os principais determinantes da composição das comunidades de peixes destes riachos. Enquanto o pH afetou tanto a substituição de linhagens e de espécies, a velocidade da água foi responsável por uma substituição de linhagens, enquanto o pH foi o principal responsável pelo aninhamento de linhagens. Nossos resultados indicam a importância dos fatores locais através da combinação entre mecanismos de preferência de nicho (velocidade da água e pH) e filtragem ambiental de linhagens (pH).},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Ecological literature offers a myriad of methods for quantifying b‐diversity. One such methods is determining BD$_{\textrm{total}}$ (BD), which, unlike other methods, can be decomposed into meaningful components that indicate how unique a sampling unit is regarding its composition (local contribution) and how unique a species is regarding its occurrence in the community (species contribution). Despite this advantage, the original formulation of the BD metric only assesses taxonomic variation and neglects other important dimensions of biodiversity. We expanded the original formulation of BD to capture variation in the functional and phylogenetic dimensions of community data by computing two new metrics — BD$_{\textrm{Fun}}$ and BD$_{\textrm{Phy}}$ — as well as their respective components that represent the local and species contribution. We tested the statistical performance of these new metrics for capturing variation in functional and phylogenetic composition through simulated communities and illustrated the potential use of these new metrics by analyzing b‐diversity of stream fish communities. Our results demonstrated that BD$_{\textrm{Phy}}$ and BD$_{\textrm{Fun}}$ have acceptable type I error and great power to detect the effect of deep evolutionary relationships and attributes mediating patterns of b‐diversity. The empirical example illustrated how BD$_{\textrm{Phy}}$ and BD$_{\textrm{Fun}}$ reveal complementary aspects of b‐diversity relative to the original BD metric. These new metrics can be used to identify local communities that are of conservation importance because they represent unique functional, phylogenetic and taxonomic compositions. We conclude that BD$_{\textrm{Phy}}$ and BD$_{\textrm{Fun}}$ are important tools for providing complementary information in the investigation of the structure of biological communities.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {© 2017 Ecological Society of Australia. Biodiversity is inherently multidimensional in nature, differences in evolutionary history, attributes of species, taxonomic composition constitutes a small fraction of whole variation present in this multidimensional space. Despite its multidimensional characteristic, biodiversity has been traditionally measured by assessing its dimensions separately through metrics of diversity. However, assessing multiple dimensions in a common framework opens the possibility of answering interesting questions that, until now, are poorly understood, such as: What dimensions capture most of the variation present in biodiversity among communities? We assess this question by extending the framework of Importance Values (IVs) to three dimensions of variation in biodiversity, functional, taxonomic and phylogenetic, and evaluate which of these captures the most variation in biodiversity space. To address this question we used data from stream fish communities of the Ivinhema River Basin in Brazil. We found that functional and phylogenetic dimensions are more important than the taxonomic dimension (represented by richness) in capturing variation in the biodiversity space formed by these three dimensions together. Furthermore, the IVs of these three dimensions were similar along an altitudinal gradient, indicating similar contributions by a given dimension in different environmental conditions. We highlight the importance of adopting a multidimensional approach when describing biodiversity, since richness (the proxy for taxonomic dimension), despite being the most commonly used, is an incomplete surrogate to capture the variation present in the biodiversity space of stream fish communities.},

                  Studies on ecological communities often address patterns of species distribution and abundance, but few consider uncertainty in counts of both species and individuals when computing diversity measures.
                
                
                  We evaluated the extent to which imperfect detection may influence patterns of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity in ecological communities.
                
                
                  We estimated the true abundance of fruit‐feeding butterflies sampled in canopy and understory strata in a subtropical forest. We compared the diversity values calculated by observed and estimated abundance data through the hidden diversity framework. This framework evaluates the deviation of observed diversity when compared with diversities derived from estimated true abundances and whether such deviation represents a bias or a noise in the observed diversity pattern.
                
                
                  The hidden diversity values differed between strata for all diversity measures, except for functional richness. The taxonomic measure was the only one where we observed an inversion of the most diverse stratum when imperfect detection was included. Regarding phylogenetic and functional measures, the strata showed distinct responses to imperfect detection, despite the tendency to overestimate observed diversity. While the understory showed noise for the phylogenetic measure, since the observed pattern was maintained, the canopy had biased diversity for the functional metric. This bias occurred since no significant differences were found between strata for observed diversity, but rather for estimated diversity, with the canopy being more clustered.
                
                
                  We demonstrate that ignore imperfect detection may lead to unrealistic estimates of diversity and hence to erroneous interpretations of patterns and processes that structure biological communities. For fruit‐feeding butterflies, according to their phylogenetic position or functional traits, the undetected individuals triggered different responses in the relationship of the diversity measures to the environmental factor. This highlights the importance to evaluate and include the uncertainty in species detectability before calculating biodiversity measures to describe communities.},

The unequal distribution of NBT results from historical and socioeconomic factors and has implications for both the Global North and South countries. For the Global North, which concentrates most of NBT, we found a mismatch between NBT housed in their ichthyological collections and their native biotas. On the other hand, countries with most NBT of their native species housed elsewhere face a barrier in advancing biodiversity research due to the difficulty in accessing reference material, hampering global efforts in cataloging, reviewing, and describing new species. We advocate that if we are truly committed to advancing biodiversity research, we should pursue global initiatives to make the distribution of biological knowledge fairer among countries, which involves programs for specimen repatriation and facilitation of accessibility of NBT material to researchers from the countries in which they were collected.},

            Despite the disjunct distribution of the Amazonian and the Atlantic forests, three historical connections between those biomes have been hypothesized: through Northeast Brazil, the Brazilian Cerrado, and the Southeast–Northwest. Temporal variation has been suggested to occur in these connections, with recent connections for the Northeast and older connections for the Southeast–Northwest. We tested for the hypothesis of temporal variation in these connections using Neotropical mammals as a study group. Phylogenetic and spatial data of sister groups from each forest were combined to access the spatiotemporal patterns of these connections. The relationship between distance route and divergence times was tested using linear regression. The results revealed that the previously suggested spatiotemporal pattern was corroborated only for Rodentia but not for Didelphimorphia and Chiroptera, showing both old and recent connections for all routes. In addition, each family revealed specific connections at different times. We refute the previously proposed absence of old connections through the Northeast route. Rather, temporal variation in the Northeast differs among the mammalian groups according to their evolutionary histories. Owing to the biogeographical history of each group, different connections were found at different times. Therefore, connections between these forests cannot be explained by a single spatiotemporal pattern.},

In this article we introduce a simulation approach coupled to approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) that parameterizes both the adaptation rate of species' niche positions over the evolution of a monophyletic lineage and the intensity of dispersal limitation associated with the variation of species alpha diversity among assemblages distributed across spatial and environmental gradients. The analytical tool was implemented in the R package 'mcfly' (

We evaluated the statistical performance of the analytical framework using simulated datasets, which confirmed the suitability of the analysis to estimate adaptation rate parameter but showed to be less precise in relation to the dispersal limitation parameter. Also, we found that increased dispersal limitation levels improved the parameterization of the adaptation rate of species' niche positions in simulated datasets. Further, we evaluated the role played by niche evolution and dispersal limitation on species alpha diversity variation of Phyllostomidae bats across the Neotropics. The framework proposed here shed light on the links between niche evolution, dispersal limitation and gradients of biological diversity, and thereby improved our understanding of evolutionary imprints on current biological diversity patterns.},

Understanding the evolutionary context of communities provides important insights into large-scale mechanisms that structure them. This review aims to: (i) discuss the main concepts of phylogenetic ecology and its application to Neotropical stream fishes; and (ii) highlight the main methods applied in this background. The first section presents the main phylogenetic hypothesis of fishes and discusses how their gaps in Neotropical stream fishes hinder phylogenetic ecology.

The second section introduces the main methods to address the phylogenetic ecology, including a standardized procedure to edit fish phylogenetic trees, comparative methods, and indices and analytical tools to understand community structure and conservation importance.

              Aim
              Speciation, extinction and historical dispersal are the ultimate factors generating and maintaining biodiversity. However, methods of macroevolution used to detect historical processes usually ignore the variation of macroevolutionary processes at scales finer than entire regions. Likewise, biogeography and community ecology often ignore deep‐time evolutionary processes. To overcome this problem, it is necessary to integrate data from ancestral state reconstructions, current species distributions and biogeographical regionalization. Herodotools is an R package designed to perform this integration.

              Major taxa studied
              
                Any taxa, with an example from small rodents (genus
                Akodon
                and subfamily Sigmodontinae).
              
            
            
              Methods
              Herodotools streamline analyses of historical biogeography, including regionalization, calculation of assemblage age, lineage in situ diversification and community phylogenetic metrics, merging species occurrence with macroevolutionary methods of ancestral area and trait reconstruction. The main functions of our R package are presented with toy examples and by analysing the historical biogeography of small rodent assemblages in the Neotropics.
            
            
              Results
              Our package can integrate methods from biogeography, macroevolution and community ecology, allowing us to downscale the effects of historical processes and calculate important historical variables (e.g., age of assemblages, in situ diversification, phylogenetic regionalization, phylogenetic transition zones, metrics of trait macroevolutionary dynamics and new metrics of phylogenetic diversity and endemism) in different scales, from entire regions to communities of co‐occurrent species.
            
            
              Main Conclusions
              Herodotools is the first platform to streamline the analysis of historical biogeography, enabling a better understanding of historical processes at different levels of organization, from local assemblages to entire biogeographical regions and incorporating macroevolutionary models in commonly used community phylogenetic metrics. This integration bridges the gap between macroevolutionary, biogeography and community ecology methods.},

              Aim
              In this study, we sought to understand how the Linnean shortfall (i.e., the lack of knowledge about species taxonomy) interacts with the Darwinian shortfall (i.e., the lack of knowledge about phylogenetic relationships among species), which potentially jeopardises geographical patterns in estimates of speciation rates.
            
            
              Location
              New World.
            
            
              Taxon
              Coralsnakes (Serpentes: Elapidae).
            
            
              Methods
              We created an index of taxonomic uncertainty (ITU) that measures the likelihood of current species being split after undergoing future taxonomic revisions. The ITU was used in simulations where species with higher taxonomic uncertainty had a higher likelihood of having their phylogenetic branches split, generating new hypothetical species along their geographic ranges. We estimated the speciation rates before and after the split of taxonomically uncertain species.
            
            
              Results
              We found that a high number of coralsnake species display substantial taxonomic uncertainty, positively correlated with the latitude of the species' geographical range centroid. The estimated speciation rates based on currently available data have a weak relationship with latitude. However, after incorporating taxonomic uncertainty into the phylogeny, we detect a higher positive correlation between speciation rate and latitude.
            
            
              Main Conclusions
              The observed change in speciation rates following the incorporation of taxonomic uncertainty highlights how such uncertainty can undermine the empirical evaluation of geographical patterns in speciation rates, revealing an interaction between the latitudinal taxonomic gradient and the latitudinal diversity gradient. Given that taxonomic changes can alter the number of species recognised as valid over time, our study highlights the need to incorporate taxonomic uncertainty into macroecological and macroevolutionary studies, enhancing the robustness of patterns inferred from these data.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic indexes summarize the evolutionary information within a given assemblage pool based on the topology and branch lengths of a hypothesized phylogenetic tree. However, different historical contingencies experienced by these assemblages can unevenly distribute evolutionary information through time and over the phylogeny. ‘treesliceR' is an R package containing tools to flexibly cut phylogenies at different depths, and also has built‐in functions to assess spatially explicit phylogenetic patterns over time. ‘treesliceR' can slice phylogenies in any temporal orientation (‘rootwardly' or ‘tipwardly'), using different criteria (million years or phylogenetic diversity). Moreover, ‘treesliceR' contains functions to assess the rates of accumulation of any phylogenetic information (e.g. α and β diversities) through time. These functions are unique to the package and provide outputs that are ready‐to‐use in graphing functions. We demonstrated the main uses of ‘treesliceR' by investigating areas of paleo‐endemism and neo‐endemism of Passeriformes in Australia. Finally, we mapped rates of accumulation of phylogenetic β‐diversity (Cpβ
              rate
              ) across Australia. ‘treesliceR' is an open‐source R package under continuous progress, designed to decompose temporally any phylogenetic information.},
